## Objective

In this section we'll add the built Bot Flow to an inbound interaction. You will add Bot Flow Properties, so you're customer can initiate the bot and generate information based on utterances for their intent. It is important that the bot understands the customers needs, and becomes personalized based on the requests. This cuts out redundancy or generic offerings from the bot. 

You'll be able to test your bot, it's output accuracy, and how to escalate to a live agent when necessary. It is important to test the bot's full scope of capabilties and ensure it is acting as expected before publishing.
