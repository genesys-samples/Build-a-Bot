**Intents** describe a goal or task that a user wants to do, such as checking their balance or sending a payment. A user will interact with a bot to resolve their intent. The dialog model you build must identify a user’s intent accurately based on their input.

A user might say: “I need to transfer $100 from savings to checking.” or “I want to transfer $100 from savings to checking”. The intent of the user is to transfer funds, though the phrases that they use to convey the intent are different

When creating intents for your chat bot, try to create one intent per activity. Let’s say your bot is in a banking domain, and your bot can tell customers about their account balance or transfer funds. It is a good practice to create one intent for balance enquiry and one intent for transfer funds.
