## Bot Concepts


**Bot**- A software application used to conduct an on-line conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent

**Dialog Engine Bot Flows**- Genesys Dialog Engine Bot Flows allow a user to create bots that will be able to understand and respond to information that customers provide. It allows you to build flows that use natural language understanding (NLU) to process the meaning of text or speech input from a human and communicate information back to them. It can then carry out the actions for the user and get them to the right outcome, whether that be full self service or assisted help with an agent.

**NLU**- Natural language understanding (NLU) is a branch of artificial intelligence that uses computer software to understand input made in the form of sentences in text or speech format

## Natural Language Understanding Concepts

The NLU uses the following key terms in the software and throughout this document:

**Intents** - The intention of the user. What is the user trying to do?

**Utterances**- The text used by the user to describe their Intent

**Slots** - A Slot is a specific piece of information that can be derived from an utterance and is used to fulfil the user's intent

**Slot Types**- The slot type defines the type of information that the bot should look for as the slot within an utterance
