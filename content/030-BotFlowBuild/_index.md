## Objective

In this section, we'll use the NLU model we've created to build out a Genesys Bot Flow. A bot flow leverages many items, including Intents, Slots, Plot Properties, Communicate Sequences, Loops, and more. Let's discuss what each of those pieces are, how to build them, and when to deploy them. 

We'll also build out Event Handling within the bot. It is important to know how to handle the unexpected, such as errors or recognition failures. We can built out events to manage this, along with agent escalation when necessary.
