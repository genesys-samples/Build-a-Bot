Utterances are phrases that a user would use to describe what they want to do. The bot tries to understand and identify the user’s intent from these utterances. <br>

A user might say: I need to send a payment tomorrow. or I want to send a payment tomorrow. Both of these utterances convey the same intention: send a payment for tomorrow. Another utterance might be: Send $100 to account 12345 tomorrow. <br>

When creating sample utterances, try to create variations and also with a wide range of semantics for each intent. It’s a good practice to create multiple variations of the same phrase. For example, create two utterances: "I want to open a savings account" and "How do I apply for savings accounts"
