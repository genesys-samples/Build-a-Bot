## Objective
By the end of this section you will understand key bot concepts, including terminology that is specific to Dialog Engine Bot Flows. A bot is a conversational method of communicating with customers. Bots are powered by natural language processing (NLU) and artificial intelligence (AI). You can build bots in Architect and then integrate them into Architect inbound call, chat, or message flows. 

Genesys Dialog Engine Bot Flows help you create bots through a natural language understanding (NLU) engine that can interpret and process information the customer provides as input. Before you begin configuring and using bots and bot flows in Architect, review and evaluate the following key concepts to help you get started.
